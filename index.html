<p><strong>How Good are Ramen Noodles?</strong></p>
<p>Brown,A. May 6, 2021</p>

<p>Ramen Noodles are known throughout the entire world and are regarded as one of the best quick foods to make. 
    These noodles are also known as a college kids’ best friend as they are <br>so convenient for people that are short on time or are on a budget with their money. 
    However, while these noodles are considered to be very tasty and convenient, 
    I feel as if people forget <br>on healthy it is to eat these noodles on a regular basis. 
    The have many redeeming qualities such as the fact that the noodles are pre-cooked, to shorten cooking time for consumers, are made <br>
    in a cup form for even quicker and easier cooking, and comes in a wide variety of flavors, so that the consumer never gets bored of them. 
    However, for these noodles to taste so good they<br> are packed with sodium, they lack protein, and a variety of necessary nutrients, which helps lead to a phenomenon 
    known as “The Freshmen 15”. These noodles may taste excellent and are<br> very convenient, 
    but they fail to offer an adequate amount of healthy nutrients that causes many people to gain weight. These noodles may be good, but is the flavor worth how unhealthy they are, the choice is yours.</p>

<p>Video game addiction is a very real problem and is steadily increasing. With a pandemic happening people were stuck in their homes for months<br> and had nothing better to do other than play video games. Over the past year, due to the pandemic, the amount of people that play video games<br> have increased exponentially. An addiction can be classified as a compulsive or uncontrolled use of a substance, or product that causes problems<br> in other areas of a person’s life. Previously known to affect the mass majority of younger people, the addiction of video games has crept into the<br> lives of older people due to the fact that many people had to work from home. With so much free time people began to game or game even <br>harder and longer than before, leading them to neglect any duties they may have in life and submerge themselves completely into fantasy.<br> As a college student with a lot of time, like most of many other students, I began to play games heavily, leading me to neglect my own duties as a student.<br> Video game addiction takes over a person’s main life and leaves sitting for hours staring at a screen causing health and mental problems.</p>
