<p><strong>BLOG POST 1:</strong><em> How Good are Ramen Noodles?</em></p>
<p>Brown,A. May 6, 2021</p>

<p>Ramen Noodles are known throughout the entire world and are regarded as one of the best quick foods to make. 
    These noodles are also known as a college kids’ best friend as they are <br>so convenient for people that are short on time or are on a budget with their money. 
    However, while these noodles are considered to be very tasty and convenient, 
    I feel as if people forget <br>on healthy it is to eat these noodles on a regular basis. 
    The have many redeeming qualities such as the fact that the noodles are pre-cooked, to shorten cooking time for consumers, are made <br>
    in a cup form for even quicker and easier cooking, and comes in a wide variety of flavors, so that the consumer never gets bored of them. 
    However, for these noodles to taste so good they<br> are packed with sodium, they lack protein, and a variety of necessary nutrients, which helps lead to a phenomenon 
    known as “The Freshmen 15”. These noodles may taste excellent and are<br> very convenient, 
    but they fail to offer an adequate amount of healthy nutrients that causes many people to gain weight. These noodles may be good, but is the flavor worth how unhealthy they are, the choice is yours.</p>
